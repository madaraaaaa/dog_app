# Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project: Dog Breed Classifier
## Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in order to build a  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  to analyse image data. Transfer learning is a technique that allows to reuse a model across different tasks. The objective is that given an image of a dog, the algorithm will classiffaction the type of dogs. If an image of a human, the algorithm will identify the resembling dog breed. If the algorithm can't identify the image as a human or dog, it will say so.
